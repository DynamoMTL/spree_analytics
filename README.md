Testing
-------
Note: the spec/dummy/config/routes.rb file gets created with an
incorrect engine name. It should be SpreeAnalytics::Engine.

Be sure to add the rspec-rails gem to your Gemfile and then create a dummy test app for the specs to run against.

    $ bundle exec rake test_app
    $ bundle exec rspec spec
